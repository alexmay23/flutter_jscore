    jsContext.release();

## JavaScriptCore

Evaluate JavaScript programs from within an app, and support JavaScript scripting of your app.

[Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore)

## dart:ffi

Foreign Function Interface for interoperability with the C programming language. flutter_jscore uses dart:ffi so you don't have to worry about performance loss across programming languages.

[dart:ffi](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-ffi/dart-ffi-library.html)
