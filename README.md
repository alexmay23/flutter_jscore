JavaScriptCore for Flutter. The plugin provides the ability to evaluate JavaScript programs from within dart.

## Getting Started

### Add plugin
```yaml
// pub
dependencies:
  flutter_jscore: ^last_version

// import
dependencies:
  flutter_jscore:
    path: Your local path

// git
dependencies:
  flutter_jscore:
    git:
      url: git://github.com/xuelongqy/flutter_jscore.git
```

### Add dynamic library

Due to the size limitation of pub on package upload, you need to add JavaScriptCore dynamic library to the project by yourself.  
You can refer to the [example](https://github.com/xuelongqy/flutter_jscore/tree/master/example). of course you can refer to [webkit](https://webkit.org/getting-the-code/) to compile it.  
You can set JscFfi.lib to use the JavaScriptCore dynamic library.  
```dart
JscFfi.lib = Platform.isIOS || Platform.isMacOS
  ? DynamicLibrary.open('JavaScriptCore.framework/JavaScriptCore')
  : Platform.isWindows
  ? DynamicLibrary.open('JavaScriptCore.dll')
  : Platform.isLinux
  ? DynamicLibrary.open('libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0.so.18')
  : DynamicLibrary.open('libjsc.so');
```

#### Android

You can get the aar file containing libjsc.so in [jsc-android](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsc-android), and add to your project.  
Take the [libs](https://github.com/xuelongqy/flutter_jscore/tree/master/example/android/app/libs) folder as an example, add it to the build.gradle of the module.
```groovy
android {
    repositories {
        flatDir {
            dirs 'libs'
        }
    }
}
dependencies {
    implementation(name:'**', ext:'aar')
}
```
You also need to add libc++_shared.so, because this is a dependency of libjsc.so.  
Take the [jniLibs](https://github.com/xuelongqy/flutter_jscore/tree/master/example/android/app/jniLibs) folder as an example, add it to the build.gradle of the module.
```groovy
android {
    sourceSets {
        main {
            jniLibs.srcDirs = ['jniLibs']
        }
    }
}
```
If your project uses C++, then you can add the code in the module’s build.gradle.
```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        externalNativeBuild {
            make {
                arguments "-DANDROID_STL=c++_shared"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### iOS and macOS

You don’t need to do anything, because JavaScriptCore comes with iOS and macOS.

#### Windows

You can use the dynamic library in the [example](https://github.com/xuelongqy/flutter_jscore/tree/master/example/windows/JavaScriptCore), or compile it yourself. And configure in CMakeLists.txt.
```text
# Add JavaScriptCore libs
install(DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/JavaScriptCore/"
  DESTINATION "${INSTALL_BUNDLE_LIB_DIR}"
  COMPONENT Runtime)
```

#### Linux

You can use libjavascriptcoregtk as a dependency, or compile [webkitgtk](https://webkitgtk.org/) yourself.  
The names of dynamic libraries in different Linux distributions may be different. So you need to set JscFfi.lib.  

ubuntn or Debian
```shell
apt-get install libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-18
```
```dart
JscFfi.lib = DynamicLibrary.open('libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0.so.18');
```

Archlinux
```shell
pacman -S webkit2gtk
```
```dart
JscFfi.lib = DynamicLibrary.open('libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0.so');
```

### Usage
```dart
import 'package:flutter_jscore/flutter_jscore.dart';

void runJS() {
    JSContext jsContext = JSContext.createInGroup();
    // Replace '1 + 1' with your JavaScript code
    JSValue jsValue = jsContext.evaluate('1 + 1');
    print(jsValue.string);
    jsContext.release();
}
```

## JavaScriptCore

Evaluate JavaScript programs from within an app, and support JavaScript scripting of your app.

[Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore)

## dart:ffi

Foreign Function Interface for interoperability with the C programming language. flutter_jscore uses dart:ffi so you don't have to worry about performance loss across programming languages.

[dart:ffi](https://api.dart.dev/stable/dart-ffi/dart-ffi-library.html)

## Supported platforms

 - iOS (7.0+) 
 - macOS (10.5+) 
 - Android (arm32, arm64, x86, x86_64) 
 - Windows (x86_64) 
 - Linux (x86_64) 
 
## Linux dependencies

If you use it on Linux, you must make sure to have the following dependencies.

 - libglib-2.0.so.0
 - libicui18n.so.66
 - libicuuc.so.66
 - libdl.so.2
 - libgio-2.0.so.0
 - libgobject-2.0.so.0

 - ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

## APIs
 
I don't think there is much to describe, flutter_jscore just makes a simple package. You can refer to the documentation of JavaScriptCore and the documentation on pub.
